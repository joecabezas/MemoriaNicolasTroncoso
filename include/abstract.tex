Model driven code generation to ease the use of a complex framework like ACS.
Code generation reduces the number of Lines Of Code (LOC) crafted by a developer,
hence the number of errors per LOC.
This approach also makes it easier for the newly introduced
to the framework to get a quicker grasp developing application.
The work done in the thesis details the specific of a code generator for the ACS framework,
introducing the
model driven development as a novel feature for the framework.
The generation framework presented in this work
is based on transforming an UML Model
into an actual implementation in the
ACS component/container framework.
The output of the generation process
is readily usable by the developer,
and further refinement and complexity may be introduced
from a working start point.
